    "### Decorators for metaprogramming\n",
    "Metaprogramming is a little outside the scope of this article, so I'll just briefly say that AST inspection and manipulation can be a very powerful tool. `pytest`, for instance, heavily uses metaprogramming to, for instance, [rewrite](http://pybites.blogspot.com/2011/07/behind-scenes-of-pytests-new-assertion.html) [assertions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/assert.html) to provide more useful error messages. [`astoptimizer`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/astoptimizer) uses it to speed up your programs. [`patterns`](https://github.com/Suor/patterns) uses it to provide convenient pattern matching. All these applications hinge, to some extent, on the useful fact that function bodies are only checked for syntactic correctness - ignoring, e.g., whether the variable names used can be resolved.  [Metaprogramming Beyond Decency](http://hackflow.com/blog/2015/03/29/metaprogramming-beyond-decency/) gives an excellent introductory overview of decorators for metaprogramming, for those interested."

    "## A final caveat\n",
    "As we all know, \"with great power comes great responsibility\". Decorators are powerful, and must always be used wisely and with good taste. As I've demonstrated, decorators can make code unpredictable - you never know what decorated function does, or, indeed, whether it's even still a function. Decorators are also for forever - you can't shuck a decorator from a function to get back to the original, un-decorated version; the decorator is an inherent part of the function's definition. Be careful and use decorators sensibly."
